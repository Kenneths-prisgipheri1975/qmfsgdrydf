Just walked out of Becoming Led Zeppelin, and my brain’s a bit like a tangled fishing line right now. Man, that theater was noisy, some guy behind me sounded like a jet engine everytime Robert Plant hit one of those high notes. Still wiping off popcorn crumbs from my knees, they went everywhere – like confetti at a rock concert, you know. My back's sore too, should’ve brought a cushion or maybe an old anchor to sit more upright.

It's wild how the   jumps into their lives—I mean, there’s this whole bit where Jimmy Page is fiddling with his guitar, looking like a wizard trying to cast a spell but kept getting distracted by the sound tech guy messing with his tapes. Didn’t think I'd get emotional over a bunch of guys just playing music in a scrappy basement studio, but here we are.

There's something about John Bonham’s drumming—like thunder trying to dance, if that makes sense? That one scene where they’re just jamming out and he's this whirlwind of sticks... I swear I felt it echoing in my chest, or maybe it was just my stomach growling. Shouldn't have skipped lunch.

> in the middle of all this, the crowd's going wild and Plant’s hair is all over the place like seaweed in a storm. My mind drifted out like a boat at sea with no map; I had half a thought about how someone asked me if I could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later. Definitely gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again when I can sit in silence, maybe with a better chair, without someone opening a bag of chips every five seconds.

Ah, and the bit with John Paul Jones talking about his quiet space, that bass—makes me think of the soft hum of the ocean on a calm day. A perfect undercurrent to all the madness. At one point, a light flickered in the back of the theater, and I thought it was part of the show, added to the chaos. Really couldn’t tell what was real anymore.

Anyway, I think I leaned too far back and heard my spine pop like a vinyl 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬—it’s fine though. Can't decide if that last scene really happened or if my brain just threw in a dream. Someone said it was supposed to be like that, maybe. Rock and roll life seems more like a storm than a sunny fishing day.

𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later... my head’s too full right now.

JavaScript: 
```javascript
function catchFish(fish) {
    let net = [];
    while(waves) {
        net.push(splash());
    }
    return boat;
}

```
